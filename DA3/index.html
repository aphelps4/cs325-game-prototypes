<h2>Cat Cafe</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Once you launch your cats, you no longer have any control over where they land.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
<ul>
<li>Using the shared object created in main for shared functions.</li>
<li>Made cats move based on angle shot from cannon. (Possibly want to make them shoot based on mouse distance from cannon as well)</li>
<li>Beds are placed randomly in four sections of the area.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I finally learned to put functions in the shared object in main instead of just copy-pasting them in every state that uses them. I also tried to make the functions generic so they are easily useable for any needs I may have from them. Unfortunately, I wasted a lot of time trying to figure out how to rotate a body just to find out that I can not access the physics type that would let me do that.
