<h2>Eternal Forest</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
It is a dungeon crawler that will let you catch the enemies and use them (eventually).
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
<ul>
<li>It is capable of calculating the stats for all characters.</li>
<li>A min and max amount of steps before battle were added so random encounters feel more balanced than pure random chance</li>
<li>It shows the health of enemies if you hover over them while in attack mode. The player health is now shown on the portraits as well.</li>
<li>It now has an experience page after a battle. This page will show the level of the team and if any teammates leveled up</li>
<li>Enemies now fight back</li>
<li>Player can save the game</li>
<li>The game will refresh and force the player to lose unsaved progress if their team dies</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
Turns out that saving through local storage does not include functions which meant that my state had to be restructured to include that feature.
Getting everything set up to allow other teammates is trickier than I imagined. I am getting closer but there are still more things I have to fix to include that.
Once I got the enemies working, I found out that having three enemies at once when level one is overwhelming and cannot be beat. While the chance of three enemies for the first
battle is low, there is still that chance and there is no fleeing option yet so I ended up just lowering the max enemy amount on the first floor to two.
The level max also felt too punishing so I created code where the max level of enemies increases with the player only on the first floor. That feels a bit fairer but
still feels unnecessarily difficult without any option to flee or heal in battle. Therefore, I have commented out this code until the player has the resources to deal with it effectively.

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fight menu font: Calibri</li>
<li>Exp menu font: Verdana</li>
<li>Rest of menu fonts: <a href="http://www.publicdomainfiles.com/show_file.php?id=13487095304649">Black Chancery</a></li>
<li>Music: self-made through Caustic</li>
<li>Sound effects: self-made through Bfxr</li>
<li>Visuals: self-made through paint.net</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Etrian Odyssey
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Move through a dungeon and fight any monsters that block your way in turn-based combat.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
<ul>
<li>This game receives input from the keyboard and the mouse.</li>
<li>The game generates random numbers when determining how many enemies the player will face and whether the player will be ambushed by enemies when moving.</li>
<li>The genre of the game is top-down dungeon crawler.</li>
<li>The play style is explorer and achiever</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Grid based movement, turn-based combat, UI, and enemy balance.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to be curious about what they will see in the forest. I want them to be excited to find new characters.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
When in the dungeon, you use your arrow keys or the WASD keys to move around the grid that makes up the world. Occasionally, a monster will pop up and the player will have to fight them in turn based combat where they select their actions and the target by clicking.
An auto-map feature is included so players can see where they are and where they have been at any time when pressing E or Shift.
The player has a hub where they can go and take a break between wandering the dungeon. Here, they can heal their team through rest or save their game.
Future: They can use items they found in the dungeon to craft things that will help on their journey. Players will also be able to catch the monsters in the forest once they have a capture item. Players can use this item to build their team with any enemy they are capable of catching in the woods.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
It is a good idea to stay near the town when wandering the dungeon at first so that you can easily head back to town to heal.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The premise is that there is a mysterious forest that prevents humans from entering with a magical barrier. The main character discovers that familiars do not count as humans and so sends their familiar wolf in to explore the dungeon, bring back treasures, and gather new information about the forest.
As they explore this new territory, they stumble across what appears to be a girl who tells them to get out before running away.
After befriending their first creature in the forest, a new discovery is made: the barrier also keeps the animals trapped inside. It is up to the player to figure out the meaning of this forbidden forest.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Eventually, I want to make it so there are a lot of choices for the player when building their party so the target audience would be players that like managing the characters they control and finding new combinations of teams.
Currently, the difficulty of this game is fairly low so casual players will be more likely to enjoy it.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
5 minutes.
