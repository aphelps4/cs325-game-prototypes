<h2>Passage</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
This game will challenge players to think as they try to solve the puzzles and discover why they are here.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
There are two separate types of gameplay: moving throughout the world and solving the puzzles. A player can not do both at once.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned how to use physics with objects in Phaser. This was useful because I did not get a chance to test that out in my last DA.
This time, learning stuff for Phaser was less difficult although there are still a lot of features I do not fully understand yet.
Due to time constraints, my code is also a bit too hard-coded for my liking so that would be one of the first things I would fix about my game if I had more time.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Button: Phaser example <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v2/buttons/action-on-click">Action On Click</a></li>
<li>Using animations: <a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v2/tilemaps/csv-map-collide">CSV Map Collide</a></li>
<li>Images and sprites: self-made through paint.net</li>
<li>Music: self-made through Caustic</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Memory Card Game
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Explore your surrounding area and solve puzzles as you try to discover what is going on and why you are here.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Person who is lost and ghost.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Input: direct, mouse, keyboard</li>
<li>Randomness: deterministic</li>
<li>Play styles: Storyteller</li>
<li>Genres: puzzle, side-scroller</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This prototype is testing how to create a side view game and puzzle design.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want them to feel curious about their surroundings and want to push through any challenges to discover the mystery of this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player will use the arrow keys to move around the map.
Left and Right will move the character left and right.
(Not implemented)Up will make the character jump.
Mouse is used for puzzles for the player to click on the cards to reveal them.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Remember the location of cards flipped in the past to solve the puzzle quicker.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The player wakes up in a mysterious area that seems to resemble a forest of sorts. They have no memories of before the forest so they push forward in order to find out why they are here and if they can recover their life from before.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game will be targeted towards those that appreciate a story.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
5 minutes.
